# Rol your WEBT Task
Exercise for the HTLW3R where students draw their assigned task from a poker deck (WEBT)

## Scenario
### 7
Carvinal Costume Store - a local store has asked you to enable them to create and list a number of costumes
along with their lending price, which can then in turn be lended by users.
(e.g.: As user I can select 2 costumes from a dropdown list and the total lending price is calculated for me)
